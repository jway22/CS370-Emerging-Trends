# CS370-Emerging-Trends


This project was to create an AI to learn how to play the Treasure Hunt game, in which the agent acted as the pirate placed in a maze. The agent had to solve the maze by getting to a designated "treasure" square. The AI would learn how to get there in the fastest path based on Q-value reinforcement with rewards and penalties for choosing good paths or bad paths, respectively. We were given some starter code and functions but we had to write the code for the implementation of the q-learning algorithm. This included setting up the epochs, the maze and agent placement, and how the agent would proceed when between each state (after making a move).

Computer scientists are people who find ways to solve problems through technology. We also find ways to enhance our lives by improving something or making a task easier. As a computer scientist, I try to approach problems by looking at the whole problem and thinking of the end goal. Then I try to reach that end goal by working my way through the problem, testing my work as I go as best as I can to make sure it works properly in the ways that I am expecting it to. My responsibilities as a programmer are to be ethical to the user and the company that I work for to avoid conflict and problems. I might be the last line of defense in programming an app that could be harmful to people and so it is my job to avoid causing those issues.
